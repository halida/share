answer is: Only from 1910 to 1955, countries that have completed full
industrialization and modern logistics have become free of offal,
because the cost of breeding and transporting meat over long
distances has been reduced, but cold chain logistics (frozen trucks)
The technology is not yet mature, and the offal decays much faster
than muscle and adipose tissue. Therefore, countries that developed
industrialized large-scale farming before the cold chain logistics
matured lacked sufficient offal distribution capacity.</span></font></font></p>
